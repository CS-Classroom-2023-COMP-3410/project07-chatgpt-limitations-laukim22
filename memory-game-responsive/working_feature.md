This is the closest I can get. There are a few bugs. However, I made this work by
so much prompt engineering. I do not know how to fix this manually. :(       )
I got chatgpt to make the borders of the game container fixed so it doesn't go off screen wildly but adjusts to the window. Additionally, this fixes the fruit border because it won't go off screen.

Once I decided to focus on the border of the actual game container, it went better.

Additionally, when I focused on the top and bottom being cut off, it fixed better, more than when I asked about the width of the container.
Lastly, it was helpful to ask specifically about the size of the cards in the grid, and focused on giving the chatgpt just the css files first.
When js was needed it provided some of this and we went back and forth with the code.

At some point the memory game functionality went away, but chatgpt brought it back. similarly, at some point I lost dancing fruit functionality, but chatgpt brought it back. With more time I could fix dancing fruit, but I wam not able to do this for the scope of this project. :()
